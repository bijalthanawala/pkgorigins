I got curious once to see where my linux packages come from
and that lead to this effort:

Tool #1: yumpkgperurls.py
Shows which URL/source yum packages come from.


Feel free to add tools for debian packages, add other tools, modify existing ones.


TODO/WISH LIST:

- Currently the use of cachefile is unintelligent.
  Use 'yum history' to turn it smart
